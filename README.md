# Project Title:
EEG Classification for Seizure Detection Using Neural Networks

## Description:
This project focuses on the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) data to differentiate between seizure and non-seizure events, utilizing advanced neural network models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of epilepsy diagnosis and study. We undertook data preprocessing to structure the EEG signals, conducted exploratory data analysis to understand signal patterns, and employed advanced visualization techniques to evaluate model performance.

## Objectives:
1. To preprocess EEG data for neural network application.
2. To utilize CNN and Bi-LSTM models for the classification of EEG signals into seizure and non-seizure events.
3. To evaluate and compare model performances using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4.To contribute to the advancement of diagnostic procedures for epilepsy and other neurological conditions through data-driven insights.

The project uses the CHB-MIT EEG Database, which contains recordings from 24 patients, providing a diverse dataset for analysis. The data, recorded post-withdrawal of anti-seizure medication, spans 916 hours and includes 173 clinically verified seizures.

## Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing: Initial cleaning and structuring of EEG data, including segmentation based on seizure activity and labeling for machine learning applications.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of EEG signals to capture temporal dynamics and seizure patterns.
3. Model Implementation: Development and training of CNN and Bi-LSTM models to classify EEG signals.
4. Performance Evaluation: Utilization of confusion matrices, classification reports, ROC curves, and accuracy comparison graphs to assess model effectiveness.

## Key Findings:
Demonstrated the capability of CNN and Bi-LSTM models to effectively classify EEG signals into seizure and non-seizure events.
Identified the strengths and limitations of each model through quantitative analysis, highlighting the importance of model selection based on specific application needs.

## Limitations and Future Work:
Outlined challenges encountered during the project, including variability in EEG signals and high-dimensional nature of the data. Proposed future directions include the refinement of classification models, real-time EEG classification systems, and personalized medicine approaches.

## Conclusion:
The project underscores the potential of utilizing advanced machine learning techniques for the classification of EEG data, offering significant contributions to the fields of medical data analysis and neurological disorder diagnosis. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research and development of more accurate, efficient diagnostic tools.
